                <h2>Jobboard -  Scrutatio</h2>
                <p>This was my first project at Epitech in the Pre-MSc program. The goal of the project was to create a job board similar to Indeed. It was a team project with certain requirements such as an administrator page with CRUD capabilities for both job offers and users, the use of a database to store data, and the use of JavaScript technology for the front end. Additionally, we implemented bonus features such as a chat for customers and companies and a sidebar with a filter for job offers. We used React.js and MUI for the frontend, Laravel for the backend, and MySQL for the database.</p>

                <h2>Dashboard - Tasseboard</h2>
                <p>This was my second project at Epitech in the Pre-MSc program. The goal of the project was to create a dashboard, which is a control panel where you can access multiple services on a single platform. We were required to include at least 6 widgets and we chose to use 3 APIs: Pokemon, Weather, and Discord. This project was developed using Java for the backend, React.js for the frontend, and MongoDB for the database.</p>

                    in our internet and media promotion. We developed it in HTML, CSS, PHP and JS</p>

                    site should contain. We realized this site to highlight our text and make it attractive.</p>
