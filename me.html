                <p> You have just landed on my website, so here are a few words to tell you who I am, what I do, and
                    what my ambitions are.<br>
<br>
                    Hi, my name is Lisa Bourdon and I am a 20-year-old living in Nantes. I have a bachelor's degree in Economics and Social Sciences, and have recently completed a bachelor's degree in Internet and Media Studies with honors. Currently, I am enrolled in a Pre-MSc program at Epitech, specializing in AI, Big Data, and VR. My passions include technology, especially AI and virtual reality, as well as music – I am a bass player. I also have an interest in science, particularly astronomy.

                    <br><br>
                    My ultimate goal is to work in the field of AI and make a positive impact on the world by using my skills in programmatic. I am always looking for challenges that require open-mindedness, creativity, and the opportunity to learn and discover new things.
<br> <br>
                    Thank you for reading and I hope to interact with you in the future.<br>
                </p>
